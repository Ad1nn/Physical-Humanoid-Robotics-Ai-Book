# Data Models: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This document describes the key data entities and information flow within a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system, focusing on the components discussed in Module 4. These are not database schemas but definitions of the data types and structures involved in integrating human language with robotic perception and control.

## 1. Voice Command Processing Data

-   **Entity**: Audio Input, Text Transcription, Intent/Entities
-   **Format**: Raw audio, text strings, structured JSON/YAML for NLU output
-   **Description**: Data related to a human's spoken command to the robot.
-   **Key Attributes/Concepts**:
    -   **Audio Stream**: Raw audio data (e.g., WAV, FLAC, streamed PCM).
    -   **Transcription**: Text generated by a Speech-to-Text (STT) model (e.g., Whisper).
    -   **Intent**: The high-level goal or purpose of the command (e.g., "navigate", "fetch", "report").
    -   **Entities**: Key objects, locations, or parameters extracted from the command (e.g., "red cup", "kitchen", "lights").

## 2. LLM Cognitive Planning Data

-   **Entity**: Prompt, LLM Response, Task Plan
-   **Format**: Text strings, structured JSON/YAML for plans
-   **Description**: Information exchanged with Large Language Models for generating cognitive plans.
-   **Key Attributes/Concepts**:
    -   **LLM Prompt**: Structured natural language input provided to the LLM, often including context, persona, available actions, and the robot's current state.
    -   **LLM Response**: Natural language output from the LLM, which needs to be parsed into actionable robot tasks.
    -   **Task Plan**: A decomposed, ordered sequence of high-level actions for the robot, derived from the LLM's response. This might be a list of symbolic actions or a sequence of executable sub-goals.
    -   **World State/Context**: Information about the robot's environment and its internal state, fed to the LLM for informed planning.

## 3. Perception-Action Loop Data

-   **Entity**: Sensor Data, World Model, Robot Commands
-   **Format**: ROS 2 Messages (Image, PointCloud2, Odometry, Twist), internal data structures
-   **Description**: Data flowing between the robot's perception, world modeling, and action execution components.
-   **Key Attributes/Concepts**:
    -   **Vision Data**: RGB images, depth maps, semantic segmentation from cameras.
    -   **LiDAR Data**: Point clouds for environmental mapping and obstacle detection.
    -   **Proprioception Data**: Joint states, force/torque sensor readings, IMU data.
    -   **World Model**: An internal representation of the environment's objects, their locations, and properties, often built from fused sensor data.
    -   **Robot Commands**: Low-level commands sent to robot actuators (e.g., `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` for base velocity, `trajectory_msgs/msg/JointTrajectory` for arm control).

## 4. Multimodal Foundations

-   **Entity**: Fused Data Representations
-   **Format**: Multimodal embeddings, aligned sensor streams
-   **Description**: Data structures and concepts for combining information from different modalities (vision, language) to build richer representations.
-   **Key Attributes/Concepts**:
    -   **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**: Models that can process and relate information from both images and text.
    -   **Multimodal Embeddings**: Vector representations of data that capture information from multiple modalities.
    -   **Cross-Modal Attention**: Mechanisms to relate elements across different modalities (e.g., attending to specific regions in an image based on a linguistic query).
