# Module Assessment

## Overview
This assessment is designed to evaluate your understanding of the core concepts presented in Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) and your ability to apply these concepts in practical coding scenarios. It comprises a set of multiple-choice questions to test your theoretical knowledge and practical coding challenges to assess your implementation skills.

Successful completion of this assessment demonstrates your foundational competency in ROS 2, preparing you for more advanced topics in subsequent modules.

## Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)

## Practical Coding Challenges

These challenges require you to apply the concepts and skills learned in Module 1 to solve practical problems. You should aim to produce working ROS 2 code that demonstrates your understanding.

### Challenge 1: Fix Broken Node Communication

**Scenario**: You are given a ROS 2 package containing two Python nodes: a publisher (`broken_talker.py`) and a subscriber (`broken_listener.py`). The publisher is supposed to send "Hello" messages, and the subscriber is supposed to receive and print them. However, they are not communicating.

**Task**: Identify and fix the issues preventing communication between `broken_talker.py` and `broken_listener.py`. The fix should involve ensuring they use the same topic name and message type, and potentially checking QoS settings if applicable.

**Files provided**:
*   `code-examples/module1-ros2-nervous-system/assessment/broken_talker.py`
*   `code-examples/module1-ros2-nervous-system/assessment/broken_listener.py`

### Challenge 2: Add a New Joint to URDF

**Scenario**: You have a simplified URDF model of a robot arm. You need to extend its functionality by adding an additional rotational joint and a link.

**Task**: Modify a provided `simple_arm.urdf.xacro` file to add an extra revolute joint and a new link (e.g., a "hand" or a "tool_mount") at the end of the existing arm. Ensure the new joint has appropriate limits and axis of rotation. Visualize your modified robot in RViz2 to confirm the addition.

**Files provided**:
*   `code-examples/module1-ros2-nervous-system/assessment/simple_arm.urdf.xacro`

### Challenge 3: Implement a Custom Service

**Scenario**: You need a way to remotely control a robot's LED light. You will implement a ROS 2 service that allows a client to request a specific color for the LED.

**Task**: Create a new ROS 2 Python package and implement:
1.  A custom service message type (e.g., `SetLEDColor.srv`) that takes a `string color` (e.g., "red", "green", "blue") as a request and returns a `bool success` and `string message` as a response.
2.  A service server node (`led_controller_server.py`) that offers this `SetLEDColor` service. When called, it should log the requested color and simulate setting the LED (e.g., by printing a message "Setting LED to [color]").
3.  A service client node (`led_controller_client.py`) that calls this service to set the LED color to "green".

**Expected outcome**: The service client successfully calls the service, and the server logs the action and returns a successful response.

## Assessment Rubric and Passing Criteria

Your performance in this module's assessment will be evaluated based on the following rubric and passing criteria:

### Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
*   **Grading**: Each question is worth 10 points.
*   **Passing Criteria**: A score of 70% (7 out of 10 questions correct) or higher is required to pass the MCQ section.

### Practical Coding Challenges
Each challenge will be graded based on:

1.  **Correctness (50%)**:
    *   **Challenge 1**: Nodes communicate correctly; identified issues are resolved.
    *   **Challenge 2**: New joint and link are correctly added to the URDF; model visualizes without errors; joint limits and axis are appropriate.
    *   **Challenge 3**: Custom service type is correctly defined; service server and client function as expected; communication is successful.
2.  **Code Quality (30%)**:
    *   Readability, clear comments, adherence to Python best practices (PEP 8 where applicable).
    *   Proper use of ROS 2 `rclpy` constructs.
3.  **Understanding (20%)**:
    *   Demonstrated understanding of underlying ROS 2 concepts (e.g., topic names, message types, URDF structure, service definitions).
    *   Ability to debug and troubleshoot issues.

*   **Passing Criteria for Challenges**:
    *   **Challenge 1**: Must demonstrate working communication between the nodes.
    *   **Challenge 2**: The modified URDF must be valid and visualize correctly in RViz2, with the new joint movable.
    *   **Challenge 3**: The custom service must be callable, and the server/client interaction must be successful.
*   **Overall Passing Criteria for Practical Challenges**: Successful completion of at least 2 out of 3 challenges.

### Overall Module Assessment Passing Criteria
To successfully pass Module 1, you must:
1.  Achieve at least 70% in the Multiple Choice Questions section.
2.  Successfully complete at least 2 out of 3 Practical Coding Challenges.

This rubric provides a clear framework for evaluating your mastery of Module 1's learning objectives.
