# Clarifying User's Reference to package.json and package-lock.json

## Prompt

```text
one package-lock.json and package.json
```

## Response

```text
You mentioned `package-lock.json` and `package.json`. These files already exist in the root of the project. My `git status` command earlier reported "nothing to commit, working tree clean," which means there are no uncommitted changes to these specific files.

Are you referring to:
1.  **New versions** of the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in the *root* directory that you have modified *after* our last commit?
2.  **Completely new** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files that you've created in a *subdirectory* (e.g., within a newly installed Docusaurus project)?

If it's the first case, you would need to make new modifications to these files for Git to detect them. If it's the second case, please tell me the subdirectory where these new files are located.
