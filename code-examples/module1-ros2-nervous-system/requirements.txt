# Python dependencies for Module 1 ROS 2 examples
# ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill uses Python 3.10
# rclpy is the ROS 2 Python client library, typically installed as part of ROS 2
# For explicit dependency tracking, could add if needed for specific setup
# Example:
# rclpy # usually system installed
# colcon-common-extensions # for workspace management

# Minimal setup, assuming ROS 2 is sourced
# Add specific packages if they are to be pip installed

numpy==1.26.2
opencv-python==4.9.0.80 # For image processing in camera_pipeline.py
# cv_bridge is typically installed via ROS 2, but opencv-python is its underlying dependency
