# Placeholder for Unity Project

This directory is intended to hold the Unity project for Chapter 2.2.

Due to the complexity of Unity project files, a full project is not included directly in this repository. To complete the exercises for this chapter, please follow these steps:

1.  Create a new **3D URP** or **3D HDRP** project in Unity Hub (Version 2022.3.x LTS).
2.  Follow the instructions in **Chapter 2.2** to install the `ROS-TCP-Connector` and `URDF-Importer` packages.
3.  Import the base humanoid URDF file from `code-examples/module2-the-digital-twin/shared/humanoid_base.urdf.xacro`.
4.  Create a `Scripts` folder inside your Unity `Assets` directory and add the C# scripts provided in this module.

This approach keeps the repository lightweight and ensures you get hands-on experience with the Unity project setup process.
